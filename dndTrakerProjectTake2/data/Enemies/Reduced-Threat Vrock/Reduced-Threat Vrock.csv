The vrock has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.," Multiattack. The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons. Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. Talons. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage. Spores (Recharge 6). A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it. Stunning Screech (1/Day). The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the vrock's next turn.",,,,,,,
