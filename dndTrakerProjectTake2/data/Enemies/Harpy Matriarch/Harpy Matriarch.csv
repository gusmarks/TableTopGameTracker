The song ends if the matriarch is incapacitated.While charmed by the matriarch, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the matriarch, the target must move on its turn toward the matriarch by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the matriarch, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.A target that successfully saves is immune to this matriarch's song for the next 24 hours. Visage of Desire (1/Day).
