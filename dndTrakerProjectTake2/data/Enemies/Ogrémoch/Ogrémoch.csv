Ogrémoch,PotA,Gargantuan,elemental,neutral evil,20 (natural armor),526 (27d20 + 243),"50 ft., burrow 50 ft.",26,11,28,11,15,22,"Str +14, Con +15, Wis +8",,,"bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks",poison,"charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone","blindsight 120 ft., tremorsense 120 ft., passive Perception 12","Common, Terran","20 (25,000 XP)"," Empowered Attacks. Ogrémoch's slam attacks are treated as magical and adamantine for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks. Innate Spellcasting. Ogrémoch's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:At will: meld into stone, move earth, wall of stone Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Ogrémoch fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead. Magic Resistance. Ogrémoch has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Siege Monster. Ogrémoch deals double damage to objects and structures with his melee and ranged weapon attacks."," Multiattack. Ogrémoch makes two slam attacks. Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. Boulder. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 500 ft., one target. Hit: 46 (7d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Summon Elementals (1/Day). Ogrémoch summons up to three earth elementals and loses 30 hit points for each elemental he summons. Summoned elementals have maximum hit points, appear within 100 feet of Ogrémoch, and disappear if Ogrémoch is reduced to 0 hit points.",,," Illuminating Crystals. Ogrémoch's crystalline protrusions flare. Each creature within 30 feet of Ogrémoch becomes outlined in orange light, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius. Any attack roll against an affected creature has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature can't benefit from being invisible. Stomp (Costs 2 Actions). Ogrémoch stomps the ground, creating an earth tremor that extends in a 30-foot radius. Other creatures standing on the ground in that radius must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. Create Gargoyle (Costs 3 Actions). Ogrémoch's hit points are reduced by 50 as he breaks off a chunk of his body and places it on the ground in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of him. The chunk of rock instantly transforms into a gargoyle and acts on the same initiative count as Ogrémoch. Ogrémoch can't use this action if he has 50 hit points or fewer. The gargoyle obeys Ogrémoch's commands and fights until destroyed.",,"Ogrémoch can assert his dominion over the rock and stone around him to take lair actions on the Elemental Plane of Earth, or in any elemental earth node (including the Black Geode, described in chapter 5). On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Ogrémoch uses his lair action to cause one of the following effects:A 10-foot-radius area of rocky or earthy ground within 60 feet of Ogrémoch turns to sticky mud. Any creature on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink 5 feet into the mud and be restrained. A creature can take an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the effect on itself or another creature within its reach on a success.Crystalline spikes grow from the ground in a 20-foot-radius area within 60 feet of Ogrémoch. The area becomes difficult terrain. A creature that moves through the affected area takes 1d8 piercing damage for every 5 feet it moves there. Creatures that are knocked prone in the area also take this damage.A violent tremor shakes the lair in a 120-foot-radius around Ogrémoch. Each creature other than Ogrémoch on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone.","The region containing an elemental node in which Ogrémoch is present is seriously affected, becoming geologically unstable. This creates the following effects:Earth tremors strike the region within 10 miles of Ogrémoch's location every 2d12 hours, each lasting 1d10 rounds. At first, damage is minor—broken windows, cracked plaster, items toppled off shelves. The longer Ogrémoch remains, the stronger the tremors become. After 5 days, the tremors are strong enough to destroy flimsy structures. After 10 days, they are strong enough to destroy ordinary wooden buildings. After 20 days, they can seriously damage or destroy reinforced or fortified structures.Magnetic disturbances within 10 miles of Ogrémoch prevent compasses from functioning there.Hidden sinkholes and fissures form within 1 mile of Ogrémoch's location. A hidden sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance by any creature with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher or spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole or fissure.Natural caves and tunnels within 1 mile of Ogrémoch's lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane of Earth, allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those points.If Ogrémoch is destroyed or banished back to his home plane, the regional effects fade over the next 1d10 days.",
