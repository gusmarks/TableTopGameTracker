On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Vanifer uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Vanifer can take no other lair actions while concentrating on a spell cast as a lair action. Her favorite use of this capability is casting fireball or hypnotic pattern.If Vanifer casts misty step using this lair action, she also draws the power of the fire node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (3d8 + 2) hit points.",,
