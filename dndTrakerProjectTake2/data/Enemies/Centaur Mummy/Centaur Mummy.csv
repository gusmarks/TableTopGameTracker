The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Dreadful Glare. The centaur mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn.

A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.",,,,,,,
