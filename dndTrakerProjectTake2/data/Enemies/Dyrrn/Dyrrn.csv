Use the Daelkyr Modifications table for inspiration.Creatures within 1 mile of the passage frequently feel as if something is crawling under their skin.If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see ""Madness of Dyrrn"" below). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.If Dyrrn dies, these effects fade away after 1d10 days. Madness of Dyrrn[â€“] If a creature goes mad in Dyrrn's lair or while it can see the daelkyr, it gains a form of indefinite madness. Roll on the Madness of Dyrrn table to determine the nature of this madness, which takes the form of a character flaw that lasts until cured.
