If the mimic is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll.

Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the mimic adheres to the target. A creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. Caustic Mist (Recharge 5â€“6). The mimic sprays a fine mist of acid in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.
