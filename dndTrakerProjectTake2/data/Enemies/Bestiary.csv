This benefit lasts for 3 days, after which Asharra's wings reappear and she regains the ability to fly. Dive Attack.

Each of the five must use its action and movement on three consecutive turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain concentration while doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it.","","","","","","",""

The gate must be within 120 feet of him.","When Halaster is in Undermountain, the following effects can occur in any location within the dungeon or in any extraplanar extension of the dungeon:A magical scrying sensor appears, taking the form of a ghostly, 1-foot-diameter humanoid eye surrounded by motes of light. The sensor is stationary, though Halaster can reorient the eye to face in any direction. Halaster can see through the eye as though he was in its space. The eye can't be harmed or dispelled, but it winks out within an antimagic field. A scrying eye lasts until Halaster ends the effect (no action required).A minor illusory effect is triggered, as though Halaster had cast minor illusion in an area. Common illusions include the echo of rattling chains, the distant sound of explosive spells being cast, a dusty cloak or a rusty helm floating as though worn by an invisible figure, and illusory footprints appearing on a dusty floor.Silent apparitions of dead adventurers drift through halls and rooms as though they are lost. An apparition can't be harmed, and it doesn't acknowledge creatures or objects in any way. It can't be dispelled but is suppressed within an antimagic field.",""

Imix's slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks. Fire Aura. At the start of each of Imix's turns, each creature within 10 feet of him takes 17 (5d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature also takes 17 (5d6) fire damage if it touches Imix or hits him with a melee attack while within 10 feet of him, and a creature takes that damage the first time on a turn that Imix moves into its space. Nonmagical weapons that hit Imix are destroyed by fire immediately after dealing damage to him Fire Form. Imix can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. He can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing if fire could pass through that space. Illumination. Imix sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Innate Spellcasting.

Summoned elementals have maximum hit points, appear within 100 feet of Imix, and disappear if Imix is reduced to 0 hit points.","",""," Heat Wave. Imix creates a blast of heat within 300 feet of himself. Each creature in the area in physical contact with metal objects (for example, carrying metal weapons or wearing metal armor) takes 9 (2d8) fire damage. Each creature in the area that isn't resistant or immune to fire damage must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Teleport (Costs 2 Actions). Imix magically teleports up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Anything Imix is wearing or carrying isn't teleported with him. Combustion (Costs 3 Actions). Imix causes one creature he can see within 30 feet of him to burst into flames. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 70 (20d6) fire damage and catches fire. A target on fire takes 10 (3d6) fire damage when it starts its turn, and remains on fire until it or another creature takes an action to douse the flames. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't catch fire.","","Imix is master of heat and flames in his vicinity. He can take lair actions on the Elemental Plane of Fire, or in any elemental fire node (such as the Weeping Colossus in chapter 5). On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Imix uses his lair action to cause one of the following effects:Any fires in the lair flare up drastically, quadrupling in size (for example, a fire blazing in a 5-foot by 5-foot area expands to a 10-foot by 10-foot area). Pools or streams of lava or other molten material are also affected. Creatures caught in the area of an expanded fire are subject to the normal damage for entering or being in the fire. Creatures caught by a sudden flood of lava must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, in addition to the normal damage for contact with molten rock.A thick cloud of black smoke and burning embers fills a 40-foot-radius sphere within 120 feet of Imix, lasting until initiative count 20 of the next round. Creatures and objects within or beyond the smoke are heavily obscured. A creature that enters the cloud of embers for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.A wave of searing heat fills the lair in a 300-foot radius around Imix for an instant. Each creature other than Imix in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. Creatures that take fire damage from this effect gain one level of exhaustion. In addition, there is a fifty percent chance that any container of fluid held or carried by an affected creature (for example, a magic potion) is destroyed.","The region containing an elemental node in which Imix is present becomes vulnerable to the influence of fire. This creates the following effects:A dry, baking heat wave strikes the region within 10 miles of Imix's location. At first, effects are minor - grass turns brown, animals become listless, work and travel become very tiring. The longer Imix remains, the worse the heat becomes; after 5 days, crops die and ponds dry up; after 10 days, unprotected livestock dies, and wells and small rivers dry up; after 20 days, large lakes and rivers are reduced in depth by 20 feet and shrink accordingly.Wildfires erupt within a 5-mile radius of Imix's lair. Every hour, there is a ten percent chance that characters in this area are caught in the path of a wildfire moving 50 feet per round. Each character must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) fire damage. A wildfire continues to threaten the characters for 1d10 rounds or until they get out of its path. Wooden structures caught in the wildfire are destroyed.Lava fountains erupt from the ground within 1 mile of Imix's lair. Every hour, there is a ten percent chance that characters in this area are close enough to an erupting lava fountain to be in danger. A lava fountain creates a vent 20 feet in diameter, and hurls globs of lava up to 200 feet away. Each character within this area must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (5d6) fire damage. A fountain lasts for 2d10 rounds before subsiding.Wildfires or volcanic fissures within 1 mile of Imix's lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those points.If Imix is destroyed or banished back to his home plane, the regional effects fade over the next 1d10 days.",""

Creatures that are knocked prone in the area also take this damage.A violent tremor shakes the lair in a 120-foot-radius around Ogrémoch. Each creature other than Ogrémoch on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone.","The region containing an elemental node in which Ogrémoch is present is seriously affected, becoming geologically unstable.

At first, damage is minor—broken windows, cracked plaster, items toppled off shelves. The longer Ogrémoch remains, the stronger the tremors become. After 5 days, the tremors are strong enough to destroy flimsy structures. After 10 days, they are strong enough to destroy ordinary wooden buildings. After 20 days, they can seriously damage or destroy reinforced or fortified structures.Magnetic disturbances within 10 miles of Ogrémoch prevent compasses from functioning there.Hidden sinkholes and fissures form within 1 mile of Ogrémoch's location. A hidden sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance by any creature with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher or spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check.

On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw.

The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.","","","","","The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability.On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open them.A powerful sea hag might have the following additional lair actions:The hag fills up to four 10-foot cubes of water with ink. The inky areas are heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a steady, strong underwater current disperses the ink on initiative count 10. The hag ignores the obscuring effect of the ink.The hag chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the simulacrum spell). This hideous simulacrum is formed out of seaweed, slime, half-eaten fish, and other garbage, but still generally resembles the creature it is imitating. This simulacrum obeys the hag's commands and is destroyed on initiative count 20 on the next round.","Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.A powerful sea hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:Most surfaces are covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it.Currents and tides are exceptionally strong and treacherous. Any ability check made to safely navigate or control a vessel moving through these waters has disadvantage.Shores are littered with dead, rotting fish.

The apparition appears next to a hostile creature that Strahd can see, makes an attack against that creature, and then disappears. The apparition has the statistics of a specter.Strahd targets one Medium or smaller creature that casts a shadow. The target's shadow must be visible to Strahd and within 30 feet of him. If the target fails a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, its shadow detaches from it and becomes a shadow that obeys Strahd's commands, acting on initiative count 20.
