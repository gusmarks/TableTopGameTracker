Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of Fidelio that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 Ã— 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.

The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring. Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that Fidelio can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by Fidelio; Fidelio then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. Fidelio now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. Fidelio can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Fidelio ends it as a bonus action, or Fidelio is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, Fidelio reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.",,,,,,,
